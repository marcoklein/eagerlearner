# Learnings
## What would I do differently?
* handle "flipped" globally
  * eg handle only right side but flip everything through an abstraction layer
* dont throw components on everything.. its good but just let it evolve man
* Logging.. log high level methods at least.. something like restarting the game - that makes debugging much easier

## What woul I keep doing next time?
* "natural evolvement" of code.. build in things when you need them, dont spend too much time thinking about architecture initally
  * however, refactor as code base grows to strucutre codebase with patterns
* start with graphics and think about a story

# Still to fix
## Must
* hands of player hit every object and only left/or right hand currently has an effect
  * just add a rectangle to check what it hits

## No must
* refactor item stuff

# TODOs
## For MVP
* [x] add a "DEAD" screen / message
* [x] adjust physics parameters
* [ ] add particles on destroy
* [ ] level generator
  * [x] generate random platforms
  * [ ] generate random monsters
* [ ] more weapons = more fun :)
* [ ] add intro screen (with instructions on blackboard)
* [ ] add some more enemies / generate them

## For more
* [ ] add a timer to questions
* [ ] add different question types (e.g. count enemies)
* [ ] lobby music (probably easiest)
* [ ] add some background elements / decoration
* [ ] make teacher interactable / spawn as monster class with ai
* [ ] sounds
