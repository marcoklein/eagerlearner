## Learnings
* handle "flipped" globally
  * eg handle only right side but flip everything through an abstraction layer

### To keep
* "natural evolvement" of code.. build in things when you need them, dont spend too much time thinking about architecture initally
  * however, refactor as code base grows to strucutre codebase with patterns
* start with graphics and think about a story
